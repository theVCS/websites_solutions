An edge in an undirected graph is a $bridge$ if after removing it the graph will be disconnected.
Given an undirected connected graph, you are allowed to add one edge between any pair of nodes so that the
the total number of bridges in the graph is minimized.




The first line of each input contains two integers: $N$ and $M$,
where $N$ is the number of nodes, and $M$ is the number of edges.
Each of the following $M$ lines contains two space-separated integers: $X Y$ $(1 ≤ X, Y ≤ N)(X ≠ Y)$, which
means that there is an edge between node $X$ and node $Y$.
It is guaranteed that each pair of nodes is connected by at most one edge






Print a single line with the minimum possible number of bridges after adding one edge.




- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $N-1 \leq M \leq 10^5$
